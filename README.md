# C_projects
Some interesting C program projects.

The above food order program has mainly 5 funtionalities:

1.Create Order

2.Modify Order  

3.Generate Bill

4.Cancel Order

5.Exit

And all these funtionalities work in the same way as the real-time softwares work. 

All possible Constraints are applied.

//if any new constraint is to be added please let me know.

Thank you.
