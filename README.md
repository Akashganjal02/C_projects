# FOOD ORDER PROGRAM
// Typed and compiled with TDM-GCC 4.9.2 64-bit profiling compiler in Dev-C++ 5.11 . 

The above Food order program has mainly 5 functionalities:

1.Create Order

2.Modify Order  

3.Generate Bill

4.Cancel Order

5.Exit

And all these functionalities work in the same way as the real-time softwares work. 

All possible Constraints are applied.

//if any new constraint is to be added please let me know.

Thank you...
